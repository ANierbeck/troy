# Comming Soon
This folder is a placeholder for upcomming feature, to support parsing a `Row` into [Shapless Extensible Record](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless/wiki/Feature-overview:-shapeless-2.0.0#extensible-records)
This will require a whitebox macro, that's why we choose to implement it as a different 'flavour' of Troy.
